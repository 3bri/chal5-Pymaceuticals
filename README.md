# chal5-Pymaceuticals
for version 2
Brian Guenther

For this project, two databases were accessed that contained information on two hundred and forty nine tumor containing mice that were treated with either one of nine different drugs or a placebo and observed for up to forty five days.  The data was cleaned of duplicate information and then analyzed to produce bar and pie charts as well as a scatter plot with linear regression.  A summary of the analysis is provided within the program file.

The class activities were utilized throughout this project.  Additional information utilized included:
